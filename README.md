## Description  
Our project was inspired by the music video for the Gorillaz song called "Feel Good Inc", which features a windmill on a floating island in the sky. For this project, we focused on concepts like animation, modeling, camera movement and audio.  
  
We used the 3D modeling program Blender to create the models in our world and animate the laughing Gorillaz character and windmill blades. We used three.js as our higher-level graphics library, along with some add-ons like GLTFLoader to import the models and animations we created in Blender, and OrbitControls to allow for smooth camera movement to navigate our scene. I used the music editing program FL Studio to chop up the audio for the laughing and the music that follows.

      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Our project was inspired by the music video for the Gorillaz song called 
        "Feel Good Inc", which features a windmill on a floating island in the sky.</p>
        <p>For this project, we focused on concepts like animation, modeling, camera
        movement and audio. We used the 3D modeling program Blender to create the models
        in our world and animate the laughing Gorillaz character and windmill blades.
        We used three.js as our higher-level graphics library, along with some add-ons like
        GLTFLoader to import the models and animations we created in Blender, and OrbitControls
        to allow for smooth camera movement to navigate our scene. I used the music editing
        program FL Studio to chop up the audio for the laughing and the music that follows.</p>
        <p>To run our project, scroll down this page to the "Main page" section and click
        "Feel Good JS". The web page will load all assets and then show a play button,
        which begins playing an animation of a laughing head followed by a scene transition
        to our floating windmill island. From there, control is given to the user.</p>
        <p>To navigate the world we made, you can use the left mouse button to rotate the
        camera, the right mouse button or arrow keys to pan the camera around, and the scroll
        wheel to zoom. You can move around in the world to your heart's content.</p>
